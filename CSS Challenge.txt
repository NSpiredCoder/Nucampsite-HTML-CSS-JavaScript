Challenge Question: CSS

Question #1: 
Aside from color names and hex color codes, RGBA and HSL are another way to encode a CSS color value.

RGBA color values:
em { color: rgb(255,0,0) }      /* integer range 0 - 255 */
em { color: rgba(255,0,0,1)     /* the same, with explicit opacity of 1 */
em { color: rgb(100%,0%,0%) }   /* float range 0.0% - 100.0% */
em { color: rgba(100%,0%,0%,1) } /* the same, with explicit opacity of 1 */

HSL color values:
* { color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%) }   /* red */
* { color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%) } /* lime */
* { color: hsl(120, 100%, 25%) } /* dark green */
* { color: hsl(120, 100%, 75%) } /* light green */
* { color: hsl(120, 75%, 75%) }  /* pastel green, and so on */

Question #2:
Hex color codes typically have 6 characters that follow the #, with each set of 2 representing R (red), G (green), or B (blue), such as #ffffff. However, these two example hex codes are also valid:
#fff
#ffffff44
Why is this, and what do the two hex codes above mean?



Question #3

What does this declaration do to an element? 

margin: 10px 20px 5px;

Question #4
Two other common units for CSS lengths, aside from px, are em and rem. Briefly describe the meaning of each. 


Question #5
How do you use the list-style property? Give an example to illustrate.


Question #6
What is a pseudo-element selector? This is not the same as a pseudo-class selector. Give an example to illustrate.


Question #7
What is the !important rule in CSS, and why should you generally avoid it?
